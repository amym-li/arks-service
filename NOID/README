# Creation record for the identifier generator in NOID/noid.bdb.

erc:
who:       vagrant/vagrant
what:      unlimited sequential identifiers of form utsc.zd
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind 
       and mint an unbounded number of identifiers
       with the template "utsc.zd".
       Sample identifiers would be "61220/utsc5" and "61220/utsc77240".
       Minting order is sequential.
when:      20200830210950
where:     ubuntu-bionic:/var/www/utsc/noid
Version:   Noid 1.1.1-0.424-php
Size:      unlimited
Template:  utsc.zd
       A suggested parent directory for this template is "noid_utsc1+".  Note:
       separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
       short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
       "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
Policy:    (:G--NI--)
       This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRANITE")
         "G--NI--", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
