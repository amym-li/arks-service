# Creation record for the identifier generator in NOID/noid.bdb.

erc:
who:       vagrant/vagrant
what:      2438900 random identifiers of form kt.reeded
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind 
       and mint 2,438,900 identifiers with the template "kt.reeded".
       Sample identifiers would be "13030/ktdb0x5" and "13030/kt4v7p5".
       Minting order is random.
when:      20200903190357
where:     ubuntu-bionic:/var/www/utsc/noid
Version:   Noid 1.1.1-0.424-php
Size:      2438900
Template:  kt.reeded
       A suggested parent directory for this template is "noid_kt5".  Note:
       separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
       short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
       "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
Policy:    (:GR-NI-E)
       This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRANITE")
         "GR-NI-E", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
