who:       dsu
what:      1000000 sequential identifiers of form .sdddddd
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind 
       and mint 1,000,000 identifiers with the template ".sdddddd".
       Sample identifiers would be "741045" and "588360".
       Minting order is sequential.
when:      20200904014959
where:     ubuntu-bionic:/var/www/utsc/noid/ui/db/Test_2
Version:   Noid 1.1.1-0.424-php
Size:      1000000
Template:  .sdddddd
       A suggested parent directory for this template is "noid_6".  Note:
       separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
       short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
       "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
Policy:    (:--A-I-E)
       This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRANITE")
         "--A-I-E", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
